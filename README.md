# You can now play as Gabbro

Features:
- Spawn on Giants Deep with your ship
- Visually look like Gabbro
- Spawn Hatchling on TH
- Altered the first loop

Roadmap:
- Change traveler dialogue to refer to you as Gabbro
  - A lot of dialogue is very Hatchling specific as well, might have to just change everything
- Add dialogue with the Hatchling
  - Needs specific dialogue as well for the first loop, and for the first time you speak to them after dying
- Change the interaction with Self (or at least just the model)
- Modify some ship log cards to reflect how you're Gabbro now
